<p>This is my website, Iadorher'sBioWebsite.com. I am passionate about music, and I seek a profession within the industry. I understand the equipment, and the technology within music production. I have been an intern with a Recording and Production studio, which has helped further my knowledge. I hope to improve my knowledge of different software. I also am great at writing and research as I am an intern at BET. I hope to use this experience to help me within my own studies as a future Singer-Songwriter. I have decided to accomplish 3 goals that help me advance towards my career each month. <center><br/>This month I will: <br/> 1. Get in touch with a vocal coach named Craig Derry <br/> 2. Write a couple of Songs Exclusively for Myself <br/>3. Find my workout plan and start training.</center> </p>
