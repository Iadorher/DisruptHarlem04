<p> Hello,
<br/>
<br/>My name is I'adorher Robins. I am 18 years old, and I am a Singer. I initially was gonna say aspiring singer, but no. I define myself by what I love, and singing is it. So singer it is. Not to get super sentimental on you. I am currently a singer songwriter at a Production and Recording studio called Brooks Brovaz in Brooklyn . I initially started as an intern, but after the recording of my first song I was asked to stay on as a Songwriter, and honestly I have been learning so much. I have also acquired an Internship at BET. My job was mainly to do research for t.v. shows. I guess I also did so well there, that I have been given more hours, and more important assignments. I couldn't be happier about that either.
